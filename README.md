1. Get Qt Linguist. 
If you don't have Qt installed just copy linguist.exe to the SVP's installation dir.
Download it here: <link>

2. Run Linguist, open any .ts file (preferably in your native language ;)) and modify it.

3. If your language is still not here copy empty.ts to <your-lang-code>.ts.

4. When done, use File -> Compile to produce .qm file, place it into SVP/i18n folder and restart SVP to check your modifications.
